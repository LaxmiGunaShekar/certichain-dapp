## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure Wallet Connection:** Users can securely "log in" and interact with the application using their MetaMask wallet.
* **Decentralized File Storage:** All documents are uploaded to **IPFS** via the Pinata service, ensuring files are stored permanently and not controlled by a single entity.
* **On-Chain Document Records:** A record of each document (its IPFS hash) is stored immutably on the blockchain via a custom **Solidity smart contract**.
* **Role-Based Access Control:**
    * **Owner:** The contract deployer has exclusive rights to add trusted issuers.
    * **Issuer:** An authorized address (e.g., a university) that can verify documents.
* **One-Click Verification:** Approved Issuers can verify credentials with a single, secure transaction.
* **Public Search:** A public-facing verifier page allows anyone (like a recruiter) to look up a user's wallet address and see their portfolio of verified documents.
